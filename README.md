### - Explain how you ensure user is the right one starting the app
#### When the application start, an authentication screen is displayed and the user must authenticate as if he wanted to unlock his phone.
#### The authentication screen is the same as the default lock screen of the user.
#### If it's a fingerprint authentication by default it will asks for his fingerprint, if it's a PIN authentication it will asks for his PIN code, etc...


### - How do you securely save user's data on your phone ?
#### The accounts are just displayed when the user is succesfully authenticated, it does not store the accounts' data on the phone.
#### Each time the user wants to refresh, it deletes the displayed accounts and asks again for authentication.


### - How did you hide the API url ?
#### It is not possible to hide perfectly a string in the source code and make it impossible to find but I tried to make the reverse engineering very difficult.
#### I encrypted the API url with an XOR function before release so the the API url is never stored in clear in the release source code.
#### In the source code, the API url is an array of integer that must be decrypted with the correct key and the correct function to obtain the url string.
#### I also obfuscated the code in the release apk to make the reverse engineering more difficult.


### - Screenshots of your application 

#### Opening of the app:

#### Ask the PIN code, password, pattern or fingerprint of the user according to his default lock screen authentication option:
##### (If none it asks the user to activate it)

#### When the user click on refresh it shows again the authentication screen.

#### If the user canceled or failed the authentication the request to the API does not start and the accounts are not displayed:
